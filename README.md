## 👨‍💻 About Me

I began my career behind the scenes — maintaining systems, managing networks, and supporting educational technology.  
But along the way, I realized that the real magic isn’t just in keeping systems running — it’s in **making data work**.  
That realization sparked my transition into the world of **Data Analytics**, where I now dedicate my time to transforming raw data into meaningful insights, dashboards, and decisions.  
I'm not just switching careers — I'm evolving my impact.

Currently, I'm focusing on:
- Building real-world data analysis projects
- Practicing data storytelling with Excel, SQL, and Power BI
- Learning cloud tools & platforms (IBM, GCP)
- Reflecting and sharing everything here on GitHub
